<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>
The use of docker has been increasing a lot in the past few years. A lot of organizations and big companies are shifting their projects to docker,  therefore it's important to know how to create and maintain Docker containers and images efficiently and accurately.

Maintaining and managing a large number of Docker containers and images through a single command line interface CLI  could be tidios and tricky sometimes.  in this article we will discuss some of the tools that will help you manage all your Docker containers and images  all at a single site very easily and will definitely save you a lot of time.

<h4><b>Listing out images and containers</b></h4>
When you have multiple images and containers running in a one single machine,  it is very important to keep track off their last tags, sizes, ID’s  and other features frequently which will help you to manage them easily.

{% highlight ruby %}
sudo docker images
{% endhighlight %}

The above command will list all the images along with their latest  sizes, IDs, tags  and date of creation.

After creating the images, if you want to know the list of containers that currently exists in your system, you can use the following command.

{% highlight ruby %}
sudo docker ps
{% endhighlight %}

The above command displays the list of all running container IDs, their corresponding images, creation dates, status etc.

If you want a list of all containers whether running or not, you can simply add an option to the above command.

{% highlight ruby %}
sudo docker ps -a
{% endhighlight %}


<h4><b>Using aliases to save time</b></h4>
Some of Docker commands could be very long and hard to remember in this case you can create your own aliases and define them into your ~/.bashrc file.
Examples;
{% highlight ruby %}
alias dl=’docker ps -l -q’
alias drm=’docker rm’
alias dps=’docker ps’
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Deleting containers and images</b></h4>
To remove a particular container, you have the rm option. The syntax for this command is

{% highlight ruby %}
sudo docker rm YOUR_CONTAINER_ID
{% endhighlight %}

To find out the container ID of the container you want to delete, you can use the command which is also discussed above.
{% highlight ruby %}
sudo docker ps -a
{% endhighlight %}

In case, a container is running, you need to stop the container before trying to remove it using the following command.
{% highlight ruby %}
sudo docker stop YOUR_CONTAINER_ID
{% endhighlight %}

To remove a docker image, you first need to remove all the containers of that particular image. After that, you can remove the image using the following command.
{% highlight ruby %}
sudo docker rmi YOUR_IMAGE_ID
{% endhighlight %}

You can get the image ID of a particular image using the following command which is also discussed above.
{% highlight ruby %}
sudo docker images
{% endhighlight %}


<h4><b>Running a container in interactive shell</b></h4>
Suppose you have pulled an ubuntu image from docker hub, using the following command.
{% highlight ruby %}
sudo docker pull ubuntu
{% endhighlight %}

Now, you want to run the ubuntu container in an interactive shell. You can use the following command to achieve this.
{% highlight ruby %}
sudo docker run -it ubuntu
{% endhighlight %}
You can now access the ubuntu image using a separate interactive command shell.

<h4><b>Try removing all the dangling volumes</b></h4>
When deleting a container, it's always likely that the volume associated with the container also gets deleted with it. That kind of volume is called a dangling volume. In order to find out a list of all the dangling volumes use the following command;
{% highlight ruby %}
sudo docker volume ls -f dangling=true
{% endhighlight %}

After issuing the above command, you will find a list of all dangling volumes with their driver name and volume name if they exist.

To avoid dangling volumes, delete a container using the -v flag.
{% highlight ruby %}
sudo docker rm -v YOUR_CONTAINER_ID
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Some important commands</b></h4>
Below you will find a list of some of the most important commands that are related to images and containers that could be very handy when handling with large numbers of containers.

<b>Container commands</b>

1. In order to list all the running containers use; "docker container ls"
2. To force a container to stop use the command; "docker container kill container_id"
3. In order to get detailed information of a container use; "docker inspect container_id"

<b>Image commands</b>

1. In order to list all the local images use; "docker image ls"
2. To remove all the dangling images use; "docker image prune"

In conclusion this article provided some tips and tricks on how to properly manage Docker containers using command line and doing it efficiently and save a lot of time.
