<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>
Python is an object-oriented and high-level programming language, it's high level is in data structures and the combination of dynamic typing and dynamic building.  Often programmers like using python over other programming language due to its rapid application development as well as the increased productivity that is provides.

However sometimes when the code is complex it would be harder for the coders to write quickly and efficiently to create a working code. Below are some of Python code construct tricks that could be beneficial to some in order to write fast and efficient code.

<h4><b>How to Reverse a List</b></h4>
If we had a given list and we wanted to reverse if we can do that by using a reverse() function. The function does accept both numeric and string data type for an example look at the code below;

{% highlight ruby %}
List = ["Carl", "Mia","Joe" ]
List.reverse()
print(List)
{% endhighlight %}

Running the code will give the output below;
{% highlight ruby %}
['Joe', 'Mia', 'Carl']
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Print The Elements Of A List In Any Order</b></h4>
In case you had a list values and you wanted it to be printed in different order, you can do so by assigning the list a series of variables and let the code decide the order in which you want to print the list in.

{% highlight ruby %}
List = [1,2,3]
w, v, t = List
print(v, w, t )
print(t, v, w )
{% endhighlight %}

Running the code above will give the output below;
{% highlight ruby %}
(2, 1, 3)
(3, 2, 1)
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Use Generators Inside Functions</b></h4>
In order to write a cleaner and shorter code we can use generators directly inside a function. In the example below we can find the sum using a generator directly as an argument for the sum function

{% highlight ruby %}
sum(i for i in range(10) )
{% endhighlight %}

Running the code above will give the output below;
{% highlight ruby %}
45
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Using the zip() function</b></h4>
If we ever have many lists and we wanted it to group it in a single one we can use the zip function. The result will show each item to be grouped with their respective items from the other lists.

{% highlight ruby %}
Year = (1995, 2004, 2013, 2016)
Month = ("Mar", "Jun", "Jan", "Dec")
Day = (11,21,13,5)
print zip(Year,Month,Day)
{% endhighlight %}

Running the code above will give the output below;
{% highlight ruby %}
[(1995, 'Mar', 11), (2004, 'Jun', 21), (2013, 'Jan', 13), (2016, 'Dec', 5)]
{% endhighlight %}


<h4><b>Swap two numbers using a single line of code</b></h4>
Normally in order to swap numbers usually that requires storing it in temporary variables. But with this python trick we can do that using one line of code and without using any temporary variable.

{% highlight ruby %}
x,y = 11, 34
print x
print y
x,y = y,x
print x
print y
{% endhighlight %}

Running the code above will give the output below;
{% highlight ruby %}
11
34
34
11
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Transpose a Matrix</b></h4>
Transposing a matrix involves converting columns into rows. In python we can achieve it by designing some loop structure to iterate through the elements in the matrix and change their places or we can use the following script involving zip function in conjunction with the * operator to unzip a list which becomes a transpose of the given matrix.

{% highlight ruby %}
x = [[31,17],
[40 ,51],
[13 ,12]]
print (zip(*x))
{% endhighlight %}

Running the code above will give the output below;
{% highlight ruby %}
[(31, 40, 13), (17, 51, 12)]
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Print a string N Times</b></h4>
The usual way of printing a string in any programming language is to write a loop, but python does that in a very simple way involving a string and the number inside the print function.

{% highlight ruby %}
str ="Point";
print(str * 3);
{% endhighlight %}

Running the code above will give the output below;
{% highlight ruby %}
PointPointPoint
{% endhighlight %}


<h4><b>Reversing List Elements Using List Slicing</b></h4>
List slicing is a very powerful technique in python which can also be used to reverse the order of elements in a list.

{% highlight ruby %}
#Reversing Strings
list1 = ["a","b","c","d"]
print list1[::-1]

# Reversing Numbers
list2 = [1,3,6,4,2]
print list2[::-1]
{% endhighlight %}

Running the code above will give the output below;
{% highlight ruby %}
['d', 'c', 'b', 'a']
[2, 4, 6, 3, 1]
{% endhighlight %}


<h4><b>Find the Factors of a Number</b></h4>
If we ever need to do any calculation as finding the factors of a number or analysis we can always design a small Loop which will check the divisibility of that number with the iteration index.

{% highlight ruby %}
f = 32
print "The factors of",x,"are:"
for i in range(1, f + 1):
   if f % i == 0:
print(i)
{% endhighlight %}

Running the code above will give the output below;
{% highlight ruby %}
The factors of 32 are:
1
2
4
8
16
32
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Checking Memory Usage</b></h4>
In order to check the memory consumption of each variable that we declare we can use the getsizeof() function, as we can see below different strings length can consume different amount of memory.

{% highlight ruby %}
import sys
a, b, c,d = "abcde" ,"xy", 2, 15.06
print(sys.getsizeof(a))
print(sys.getsizeof(b))
print(sys.getsizeof(c))
print(sys.getsizeof(d))
{% endhighlight %}

Running the code above will give the output below;
{% highlight ruby %}
The factors of 32 are:
38
35
24
24
{% endhighlight %}
