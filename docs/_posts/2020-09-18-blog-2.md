<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>

Kali Linux is a powerful OS that has over 600 tools and is mainly used for security auditing and penetration testing. After installing Kali for the first time, by default, the OS wonâ€™t have the essential tools that is needed for penetration testing and white hat hackers.

Below I will explain the 10 most important steps to make after installing Kali.


<h1><b>Step 1: Installing git </b></h1>
Git is and open source software that can be used to share and edit code, and mainly is being used as the primary tool for cloning code repositories from Github. It is a must have tool for penetration testing.

To do so, open terminal and type:

{% highlight ruby %}

apt-get install git

{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Step 2: Config Aliases in Bash</b></h1>
In order to be able to create and customize command line shortcuts, you must create aliases.
To create aliases, open the /root/.bash_aliases using nano or your favorite text editor. 
Add the following line to create an alias.

{% highlight ruby %}
alias ls='ls --color=always -rthla'
{% endhighlight %}
for example, we can create an aliases that will update Kali fully;
{% highlight ruby %}
function apt-updater {
	apt-get update &&
	apt-get dist-upgrade -Vy &&
	apt-get autoremove -y &&
	apt-get autoclean &&
	apt-get clean &&
	reboot
	}
{% endhighlight %}
now when we exit and run the command "apt-updater" in the terminal, that will invoke a series of updates, which makes it much faster.

<h1><b>Step 3: Erase the Board</b></h1>
Now in order to not have any issues when we flash MicroPython to the board, we must erase it with the below command, remember to replace the serial number with your serial number;

{% highlight ruby %}

~$ esptool.py --port /dev/cu.wchusbserial14630 erase_flash

{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Step 4: MicroPython Flash</b></h1>
Now, run the following to flash MicroPython over to the microcontroller. Replace the .bin file at the end with the MicroPython binary you downloaded.

{% highlight ruby %}

~$ esptool.py --port /dev/cu.wchusbserial14630 --baud 460800 write_flash --flash_size=detect 0 /Users/kali/Downloads/esp8266-20191220-v1.12.bin

{% endhighlight %}

When it's done, you can confirm that it was done correctly by using the following command;

{% highlight ruby %}

~$ screen /dev/cu.wchusbserial14630 115200

{% endhighlight %}


<h1><b>Step 5: Jupyter Notebook Installation</b></h1>

Now, you need to get Jupyter Notebook, which is the web program that you can use to have control over Motors,relays, sensors and other devices;

First use the command below;
{% highlight ruby %}

~$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

{% endhighlight %}

Then this command to install Jupyter;
{% highlight ruby %}

~$ python3 -m pip install jupyter

{% endhighlight %}

Now upgrade Jupyter;
{% highlight ruby %}

~$ pip3 install --upgrade jupyter_client

{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Step 6: Installing Jupyter Notebook MicroPython Kernel</b></h1>
We need to install the MicroPython kernel for Jupyter Notebook. We can get it from the Jupyter MicroPython Kernel GitHub repo using;

{% highlight ruby %}

~$ git clone https://github.com/goatchurchprime/jupyter_micropython_kernel.git

{% endhighlight %}

Next, install it to Python3 with;
{% highlight ruby %}

~$ pip3 install -e jupyter_micropython_kernel

{% endhighlight %}

Now, install the kernel into Jupyter;
{% highlight ruby %}

~$ python3 -m jupyter_micropython_kernel.install

{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Step 7: Opening Jupyter</b></h1>
To open the web interface for Jupyter Notebook, use:

{% highlight ruby %}

~$ jupyter notebook

{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Step 8: Control Your electronics from Jupyter Notebook</b></h1>
First you must open the Jupyter notebook and create a MicroPython file in it by clicking on "new" then select a "MicroPython - USB" as the type.
In your Jupyter Notebook MicroPython file, use the following for the first block, making sure to use your serial port instead of mine;

{% highlight ruby %}

%serialconnect to --port=/dev/cu.wchusbserial14630 --baud=115200

{% endhighlight %}

Now, in our second block, let's create a small task to power on and off the motor;

{% highlight ruby %}

from machine import Pin
from time import sleep
motor = Pin(5, Pin.OUT)
motor.value(1)
sleep(0.2)
motor.value(0)
sleep(0.2)

{% endhighlight %}

You can also use .on() or .off() to control the pin:

{% highlight ruby %}

motor.on()
sleep(0.2)
motor.off()
sleep(0.2)

{% endhighlight %}

If you want to loop things, we can start to use different Python data structures

{% highlight ruby %}

from time import sleep
for i in range(10):
    motor.on()
    sleep(0.5)
    motor.off()
    sleep(0.5)

{% endhighlight %}

If you are a beginner in coding and don't have too much experience, MicroPython is the easiest way to learn and start interacting with your electronics like Motors, relays and other devices from your web browser.
