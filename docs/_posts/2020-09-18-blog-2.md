<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>

If you want to control electronics like motors or relays, you can do so by using MicroPython with an ESP8266 and a web browser.
MicroPython is one of the easier coding languages for beginners to program the ESP8266.

<h1><b>Requirements/tools</b></h1>
You can replace the below materials with your project needs, but for a simple example you would need the materials below;

1. D1 Mini board (or other ESP8266 or ESP32)
2. Breadboard
3. Relay
4. Motor with propeller
5. Jumpers
6. Micro-USB cable
7. 9-volt battery
8. Battery connector

<h1><b>Step 1: Identify the Serial Port </b></h1>
In Linux system, plug in the ESP8266 and run the command below to find what it’s serial number.

To do so, open terminal and type:

{% highlight ruby %}

~$ dmesg | grep tty

{% endhighlight %}

You should see a result with “wch” in it and followed by a number, ex; wchusbserial14630

<h1><b>Step 2: Download the Latest MicroPython Binary</b></h1>
Download the latest firmware based on the board you’re using. find your board, and download the file. You can find the links below to the download for ESP8266 board or ESP32. When you select your board, choose the .bin file for the latest stable release.

{% highlight ruby %}
"https://micropython.org/download/esp8266/"
"https://micropython.org/download/esp32/"
{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Step 3: Erase the Board</b></h1>
Now in order to not have any issues when we flash MicroPython to the board, we must erase it with the below command, remember to replace the serial number with your serial number;

{% highlight ruby %}

~$ esptool.py --port /dev/cu.wchusbserial14630 erase_flash

{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Step 4: MicroPython Flash</b></h1>
Now, run the following to flash MicroPython over to the microcontroller. Replace the .bin file at the end with the MicroPython binary you downloaded.

{% highlight ruby %}

~$ esptool.py --port /dev/cu.wchusbserial14630 --baud 460800 write_flash --flash_size=detect 0 /Users/kali/Downloads/esp8266-20191220-v1.12.bin

{% endhighlight %}

When it's done, you can confirm that it was done correctly by using the following command;

{% highlight ruby %}

~$ screen /dev/cu.wchusbserial14630 115200

{% endhighlight %}


<h1><b>Step 5: Jupyter Notebook Installation</b></h1>

Now, you need to get Jupyter Notebook, which is the web program that you can use to have control over Motors,relays, sensors and other devices;

First use the command below;
{% highlight ruby %}

~$ python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

{% endhighlight %}

Then this command to install Jupyter;
{% highlight ruby %}

~$ python3 -m pip install jupyter

{% endhighlight %}

Now upgrade Jupyter;
{% highlight ruby %}

~$ pip3 install --upgrade jupyter_client

{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Step 6: Installing Jupyter Notebook MicroPython Kernel</b></h1>
We need to install the MicroPython kernel for Jupyter Notebook. We can get it from the Jupyter MicroPython Kernel GitHub repo using;

{% highlight ruby %}

~$ git clone https://github.com/goatchurchprime/jupyter_micropython_kernel.git

{% endhighlight %}

Next, install it to Python3 with;
{% highlight ruby %}

~$ pip3 install -e jupyter_micropython_kernel

{% endhighlight %}

Now, install the kernel into Jupyter;
{% highlight ruby %}

~$ python3 -m jupyter_micropython_kernel.install

{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Step 7: Opening Jupyter</b></h1>
To open the web interface for Jupyter Notebook, use:

{% highlight ruby %}

~$ jupyter notebook

{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Step 8: Control Your electronics from Jupyter Notebook</b></h1>
First you must open the Jupyter notebook and create a MicroPython file in it by clicking on "new" then select a "MicroPython - USB" as the type.
In your Jupyter Notebook MicroPython file, use the following for the first block, making sure to use your serial port instead of mine;

{% highlight ruby %}

%serialconnect to --port=/dev/cu.wchusbserial14630 --baud=115200

{% endhighlight %}

Now, in our second block, let's create a small task to power on and off the motor;

{% highlight ruby %}

from machine import Pin
from time import sleep
motor = Pin(5, Pin.OUT)
motor.value(1)
sleep(0.2)
motor.value(0)
sleep(0.2)

{% endhighlight %}

You can also use .on() or .off() to control the pin:

{% highlight ruby %}

motor.on()
sleep(0.2)
motor.off()
sleep(0.2)

{% endhighlight %}

If you want to loop things, we can start to use different Python data structures

{% highlight ruby %}

from time import sleep
for i in range(10):
    motor.on()
    sleep(0.5)
    motor.off()
    sleep(0.5)

{% endhighlight %}

If you are a beginner in coding and don't have too much experience, MicroPython is the easiest way to learn and start interacting with your electronics like Motors, relays and other devices from your web browser.
