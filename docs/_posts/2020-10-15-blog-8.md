<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>
In this post we see that how ansible that is an automation layout management system, that can be installed. Ansible is a layout management system that, with ease of administration that can handle a wide number of client technology machines that can be automatically from the mid location.  

The communication of ansible is through SSH bridges and not necessarily does need to run any program on the customer computer and bring the information that troubles the actions and copies the data from the remote sensitive devices. 

The YAML information collection is primarily used for the anisble layout files since it may be attributed to descriptive language similarities. You can connect with the customers using the action line.

<h4><b>Requirements:</b></h4>
The ubuntu 16.04 is required and a non-root user is sudo-enabled. 
The people who uses wants SSh keys.

<h4><b>Installing Ansible:</b></h4>
The installation of Ansible in Ubuntu 16.044 is not included in the ubuntu current repositories since we wanted to install the ansible program on one desktop, so we’re going to connect the personal kit archives of ansible to the system.
The command to include the repository is the following.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
{% endhighlight %}

We had to upgrade the linux so that the package repository would be added to the system adter we have had added the ansible ppa to the main machine.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo apt-get update –y
{% endhighlight %}

Once the registry of the package is modified, we can install ansible using the action of the following.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo apt-get install ansible
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Host Config:</b></h4>
Keeping track of the files is a must, the file servers and the customers who we have to build the host filles to, in order to start connecting with the other customer or the server devices.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts
{% endhighlight %}

We can use all of the commented lines while opening the layout file and one of the arrangement works in the files then we want to connect the demo machines of following.
The connection of the general syntax to the host or the device to the added party.
{% highlight ruby %}
[group_name]
Alias anisible_ssh_host=your_ansible_server_ip_address
{% endhighlight %}

Setup demo file. 
{% highlight ruby %}
[Ansible_server]
Client1 ansible_ssh_host=192.168.0.10
Client2 ansible_ssh_host=192.168.0.11
{% endhighlight %}

We had to customize it to copy SSh keys to all the customer computers so that they were allowed without a password. 
Using the two customer machines in the situation and the customer technologies are available to access without even asking for security code for using the SSH keys. 
If we attempt to bind to the host with ansible, with the default setup, the action fails for the ssh keys are bound to the main user and we can see the following error.

{% highlight ruby %}
Client1 | UNREACHABLE! => {
   "changed": false,
   "msg": "Failed to connect to the host via ssh.",
   "unreachable": true
}
{% endhighlight %}

We are going to build a file that shows the servers to connection of the client machine’s root usage. 
{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo mkdir /etc/ansible/group_vars
$ sudo vi /etc/ansible/group_vars/servers
---
Ansible_ssh_user: root
{% endhighlight %}

Putting this “—“ is necessary at the beginning of the YAML format. 

We had to include those information at /etc/ansible/group vars/ all if you chose to specify all the servers at a venue.

<h4><b>Basic Ansible Execution Commands:</b></h4>
We run the following action to verify our setup, which pings all the customers in the layout file.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ ansible –m ping all
{% endhighlight %}

For the example below, we can ping the customers.
If the entire party is needed to be pinged, then we have to use the order below.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ ansible –m ping all
{% endhighlight %}

The action below is need to be used if pinging a particular machine or a customer is needed.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ ansible –m ping clien1
{% endhighlight %}

In order to install a terminal action fron the ansible to the customer , then using the shell module will be the best.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ ansible –m shell –a ‘df –h’ client1
{% endhighlight %}

Learning how to install and run basic actions and tasks, customize the ansibles, layout the customers, connect with the customers or machines, hence we can remotely evaluate and verify the setup and perform the basic tasks.
