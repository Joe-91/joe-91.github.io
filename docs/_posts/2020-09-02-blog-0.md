<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>

Apache is a free and open-source web server and its main purpose is to establish a connection between a server and the internet browsers like (Safari, Chrome, Opra, etc...)
This blog will explain how to install and run apache server on Ubuntu.

<h1>Requirements/tools</h1>
1.	A computer running Ubuntu with sudo privileges.
2.	Access to internet.
3.	Open Terminal.
4.	Have the APT package installed. (normally installed by default in Ubuntu).

<h1>The steps to install Apache</h1>
Before installing Apache, it's always a good idea to check for updates and refresh the local softwaer packages.
To do so, open terminal and type:

{% highlight ruby %}

sudo apt-get update

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>I: Install Apache</h3>
To install Apache, we use the command below. Note that the system will ask for confirmation. Must type (y) to confirm;

{% highlight ruby %}

sudo apt-get install apache2

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>II: Verify the installation</h3>
To verify the installation, you must open a web browser and type in the link below. The browser should display a page labeled "Apache2 Ubuntu Default web Page".

{% highlight ruby %}

http://local.server.ip

{% endhighlight %}


<h3>III: Firewall Configuration</h3>
Even though Apache installation is done, however, you must configure your firewall to allow traffic on port 80.
First you must display all available UFW profiles by using this command:

{% highlight ruby %}

sudo ufw show app list

{% endhighlight %}

The terminal should display a list of all available application profiles:

{% highlight ruby %}

Available applications:
  Apache
  Apache Full
  Apache Secure
  OpenSSH

{% endhighlight %}

Now you can use the command below to allow web traffic on port 80:

{% highlight ruby %}

sudo ufw allow 'Apache'

{% endhighlight %}

Verify that the change was made correctly by typing:

{% highlight ruby %}

sudo ufw status

{% endhighlight %}
