<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>

Apache is a free and open-source web server and its main purpose is to establish a connection between a server and the internet browsers like (Safari, Chrome, Opra, etc...)
This blog will explain how to install and run apache server on Ubuntu.

<h1><b>Requirements/tools</b></h1>
1.	A computer running Ubuntu with sudo privileges.
2.	Access to internet.
3.	Open Terminal.
4.	Have the APT package installed. (normally installed by default in Ubuntu).

<h1><b>The steps to install Apache</b></h1>
Before installing Apache, it's always a good idea to check for updates and refresh the local softwaer packages.
To do so, open terminal and type:

{% highlight ruby %}

sudo apt-get update

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>I: Install Apache</h3>
To install Apache, we use the command below. Note that the system will ask for confirmation. Must type (y) to confirm;

{% highlight ruby %}

sudo apt-get install apache2

{% endhighlight %}

<h3>II: Verify the installation</h3>
To verify the installation, you must open a web browser and type in the link below. The browser should display a page labeled "Apache2 Ubuntu Default web Page".

{% highlight ruby %}

http://local.server.ip

{% endhighlight %}


<h3>III: Firewall Configuration</h3>
Even though Apache installation is done, however, you must configure your firewall to allow traffic on port 80.
First you must display all available UFW profiles by using this command:

{% highlight ruby %}

sudo ufw show app list

{% endhighlight %}

The terminal should display a list of all available application profiles:

{% highlight ruby %}

Available applications:
  Apache
  Apache Full
  Apache Secure
  OpenSSH

{% endhighlight %}

Now you can use the command below to allow web traffic on port 80:

{% highlight ruby %}

sudo ufw allow 'Apache'

{% endhighlight %}

Verify that the change was made correctly by typing:

{% highlight ruby %}

sudo ufw status

{% endhighlight %}


<h1><b>Apache Service Controls</b></h1>

At this point the Apache service must be up and running. However, when managing a web server you need some sort of control over the server. For example sometimes you may need to restart or stop the server. Below are some command lines on how to do that.

Start Apache:
{% highlight ruby %}

sudo systemctl start apache2.service

{% endhighlight %}

Stop Apache:
{% highlight ruby %}

sudo systemctl stop apache2.service

{% endhighlight %}

Restart Apache:
{% highlight ruby %}

sudo systemctl restart apache2.service

{% endhighlight %}

Reload Apache:
{% highlight ruby %}

sudo systemctl reload apache2.service

{% endhighlight %}


<h1><b>Conclusion</b></h1>
In this blog, we demonstrated how to install Apache service on Ubuntu using some simple commands. Also, you learned how to configure basic settings for your installation.
