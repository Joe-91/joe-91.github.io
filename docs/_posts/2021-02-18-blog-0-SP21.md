<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>
In my CIT 384 class we are working on a final group project, which is to create a News Web App that uses the Bing News API to lookup different types of news articles. In our project we are supposed to install and use Meteor Js.

Weâ€™ve been working on the project in a GitHub repository but at the end we must host it in the cloud somewhere, so we decided to host it on AWS.

Meteor is an open source and one of the leading in JavaScript framework. Made to create and design web, desktop and mobile apps easily and efficiently.

<h1><b>Below are the steps on how to install and run Meteor on AWS.</b></h1>
Fisrt we have to update the packager with the below command;

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo apt-get update
{% endhighlight %}

Then install the software properties of python

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
{% endhighlight %}

Now we install npm (the biggest library for Js).

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo apt-get install npm
{% endhighlight %}

Now nvm and node install.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.11.1/install.sh | bash

$ nvm install 4.4.7

$ nvm use 4.4.7

{% endhighlight %}

Then AWS CLI install.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo apt-get install awscli
{% endhighlight %}

Now install Meteor up.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo npm install -g mupx

$ sudo npm install -g mupx-letsencrypt
{% endhighlight %}

Then to initialize mupx by going to the project directory.
{% highlight ruby %}
$ mupx-letsencrypt init
{% endhighlight %}

Finally we install Meteor with the command below;

{% highlight ruby %}
$ curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
{% endhighlight %}

Now we have to edit mup.json to make sure the username and the location of our private key are correct and we do so by using nano text editor. "$ nano mup.json"

Lastly we have to setup Meteor and deploy the project by running the following commands in project directory;

{% highlight ruby %}
$ mupx-letsencrypt setup

$ mupx-letsencrypt deploy
{% endhighlight %}
