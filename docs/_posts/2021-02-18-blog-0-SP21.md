<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>
If you have a GitHub repository and working on it with multiple people that commit changes ant do push and you are worried about the master to get corrupt if someone does something wrong then you must create branches to keep the master safe. 

Each time someone wants to commit and push they will create a new branch which will be a copy of the master and below I will explain how to crate branches.

<h1><b>Below are the steps on how to Create and manage branches in GitHub.</b></h1>
Before creating a branch you must make sure everything is up to date by doing a pull.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ git pull
{% endhighlight %}

Now we create a branch on our local machine and switch into it.

{% highlight ruby %}
$ git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
{% endhighlight %}

Now we push it to GitHub

{% highlight ruby %}
$ git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
{% endhighlight %}

Now before commiting anything in our branch we have to make sure we are in it.
Add-u is used to set up the upstream.

Also we can see all created branches by typing:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ git branch -a
{% endhighlight %}

An example of the result would be:

{% highlight ruby %}
* approval_messages
  master
  master_clean
{% endhighlight %}

Adding a new remote to the branch:
{% highlight ruby %}
$ git remote add [name_of_your_remote] [name_of_your_new_branch]
{% endhighlight %}

Pushing changes from our commit to the branch:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ git push [name_of_your_new_remote] [url]
{% endhighlight %}

Updating the branch when the original branch has been updated:
{% highlight ruby %}
$ git fetch [name_of_your_remote]
{% endhighlight %}

Then we need to apply a merge changes:
{% highlight ruby %}
$ git merge [name_of_your_remote]/develop
{% endhighlight %}

Deleting a branch in our local filesystem:
{% highlight ruby %}
$ git branch -d [name_of_your_new_branch]
{% endhighlight %}

Force delete a branch on the local file system:
{% highlight ruby %}
$ git branch -D [name_of_your_new_branch]
{% endhighlight %}

deleting a branch from GitHub:
{% highlight ruby %}
$ git push origin :[name_of_your_new_branch]
{% endhighlight %}
