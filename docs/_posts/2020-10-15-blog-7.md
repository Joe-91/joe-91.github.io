<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>
Some of the C++ programming language we can see here and that is will support us in the various fields. Those tricks will help us minimize the time to write codes, as though we want to compete in any competitive programming competitions. Here we see every one of them in these cases.

Verifying to see if the number is off or even without the percent operator being used. This trick is straightforward which means that we can execute bitwise and this number with 1. This is an odd if the consequence is not zero, otherwise it would be even. The logic here is so clear. If all odd numbers have 1 then it’s LSB. So this means that to get desired effect quickly, all the characters will be masked but LSb after operating with 1.

{% highlight ruby %}
if ((n & 1) != 0){
   //this is odd
} else {
   //This is even
}
{% endhighlight %}

Using the move operator to easily multiply and split. If we choose to multiply a number with a number such as 2n, we can easily alter the number n times to the left. Therefore, it we agree to break a number with 2n, then change the number to n times correct.

{% highlight ruby %}
x = 40;
y = x << 2; //x will be multiplied with 4, so y = 160
cout << x;
x = 40;
y = x >> 2; //x will be divided by 4, so y = 10
cout << x;
{% endhighlight %}

Without the use of third variables, we can switch two numbers. Using the plus and minus operators to do this. However, we can also achieve this by operating bitwise XOR. To ensure that we should manually verify the numbers.

{% highlight ruby %}
//swap x and y
x ^= y;
y ^= x;
x ^= y;
{% endhighlight %}

Often there are certain restrictions that should not be included in our code for the strlen () feature. Because of this we establish own features, strlen. If the characters are accessed by the case, so we just need not to do it. We may verify if the character is true at location or not which is non-zero. 

{% highlight ruby %}
for(int i = 0; s[i]; i++) {
   cout << s[i];
}
{% endhighlight %}

We most commonly use the push back () feature in STL to connect new elements to such containers, such as vectors. We can use emplace back () without doing it, as well. This feature is much quicker. It does not delegate memory elsewhere, but attaches reserved memory to the container.

C++ offers a built in GCD feature. In separate instances, we will have them. The syntax looks like the following.

{% highlight ruby %}
__gcd(x, y) //find GCD of x and y
{% endhighlight %}

The overall array size for the key feature is of the range of 10 power of 6. However, we can announce the size up to the 10 power of 7 if the arrangement is announced globally. Using the log operations, we can measure the most important digit of any number. To more clarify it, the following below.

{% highlight ruby %}
n = 4578;
double k = log10(n);
k = k – floor(k);
int x = pow(10, k); //x is the most significant digit
{% endhighlight %}

Computing the numbers explicitly by operating the log. There is no curve that we have for it.

{% highlight ruby %}
n = 4578;
int digit_count = floot(log10(n)) + 1
{% endhighlight %}

By this logic, we should verify the number is ^2 or straightforward.

{% highlight ruby %}
x = 1024;
bool check = x && (!(x & (x-1))); //if this is true, then power of two.
{% endhighlight %}

In C++, there are several built-in algorithms that should verify the situations below.

{% highlight ruby %}
all_of(left, left + n, isPositive()); //check all are positive or not
any_of(left, left + n, isPositive()); //check at least one positive or not.
none_of(left, left + n, isPositive()); //check no elements are positive
{% endhighlight %}

Copy feature allowing components to be transferred from one container to another.

{% highlight ruby %}
int src[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int des[5];
copy_n(src, 5, dest);
{% endhighlight %}

An algorithm named it exists. This should be used to construct a set of numbers that increase relatively, as it by giving the initial number and then applying the post increase operator for this value.

{% highlight ruby %}
int arr[5] = {0};
char str[5] = {0};
itoa(arr, arr+5, 15); //it will generate {15, 16, 17, 18, 19}
itoa(str, str+5, ‘A’); //it will generate {‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘E’}
{% endhighlight %}

In binary type, allocate meaning. We may use a prefix of 0b for any binary value to indicate that the binary value is supplied.

{% highlight ruby %}
int x = 0b1101; //then x will hold 13
{% endhighlight %}

In C++ without the use of condition operators, we should operate keywords. It is possible to operate the keyword.

{% highlight ruby %}
x = 10;
if(x < 10 and x > 5)
   cout << “True” << endl;
else
   cout << “False” << endl;
   //This will return True
{% endhighlight %}
