<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>
On the amazon EFS file systems there will be EC2 instance which will be working an apache web server that serves files. It will be either an EC2 instance, or should have many EC2 instances serving files from the amazon EFS file system if the program needs it. 

On the amazon EFS file systems there will be EC2 instance which will be working an apache web server that serves files. It will be either an EC2 instance, or should have many EC2 instances serving files from the amazon EFS file system if the program needs it.

- 	First of all, In the getting started exercise, the following steps are to have a working setup composed of the following:

 o	File system for amazon EFS. 
 o	EC2 Instance. 
 o	The file system installed on the example of EC2. 

   o	It is important to follow the instructions to get started with the amazon elastic file system for guidance. The steps are the following: 
o	The public DNS name of the EC2 instance. 
o	The mount target’s public DNS name was generated in the same availability zone where it began the EC2 case.


-	Second of all, to get started exercise, choosing to unmount the file system from the point to build, this is step is also optional. Then you built another mounting point for the file system in this step.

   {% highlight ruby %}
   $ sudo umount  ~/efs-mount-point
   {% endhighlight %}
  
-  Third, installing the apache web server on the EC2 example and setup it as follows:
o	Link to an instance of the EC2 and mount an apache web server.
{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo yum -y install httpd
{% endhighlight %}
o	Begin the service. 
{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo service httpd start
{% endhighlight %}
o	Build a mount point.
{% highlight ruby %}
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf file points to /var/www/html (DocumentRoot "/var/www/html").
{% endhighlight %}
o	The amazon efs file manager will be installed in the subdirectory beneath the file system. 
o	Under /var/www/html, build an efs-mount-point subdirectory.
{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo mkdir /var/www/html/efs-mount-point
{% endhighlight %}
o	Mount your file server on amazon efs. By the supplying your file system ID, it is important to be up to date the mount commands using the EFS help guide.
{% highlight ruby %}
$ sudo mount -t efs fs-12345678:/ /var/www/html/efs-mountpoint
{% endhighlight %}
      
- Lastly, getting the setup checked.
o	Apply the EC2 instance protection community rule that it is build in the getting started exercise to let HTTP traffic from TCP port 80 onwards. 
o	Build a sample html file.
	Change directory.
{% highlight ruby %}
$ cd /var/www/html/efs-mount-point
{% endhighlight %}
	Create a subdirectory for the partial directory and alter possession. Also, adjust the directory such that files should be generated in the sampled subdirectory.
{% highlight ruby %}
$  sudo mkdir sampledir  
$  sudo chown  ec2-user sampledir
$  sudo chmod -R o+r sampledir
$  cd sampledir  
{% endhighlight %}
	Build a sample hello.html file.
{% highlight ruby %}
$ echo "<html><h1>Hello from Amazon EFS</h1></html>" > hello.html 
{% endhighlight %}
o	Use the URL into the browser to allow the public file that the EC2 instance’s DNS name continued by the file name. an example is the following:
{% highlight ruby %}
http://EC2-instance-public-DNS/efs-mount-point/sampledir/hello.html
{% endhighlight %}
-	Websites saved on an amazon efs file server are now supported. Notice this configuration does not configure the EC2 instance to launch httpd web server automatically on the EC2 instance boot, which does not install the file system at boot time either.
