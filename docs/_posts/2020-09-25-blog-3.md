<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>

Kali Linux is a powerful OS that has over 600 tools and is mainly used for security auditing and penetration testing. After installing Kali for the first time, by default, the OS won’t have the essential tools that is needed for penetration testing and white hat hackers.

Below I will explain some important steps to take after installing Kali.


<h1><b>Step 1: Installing git </b></h1>
Git is and open source software that can be used to share and edit code, and mainly is being used as the primary tool for cloning code repositories from Github. It is a must have tool for penetration testing.

To do so, open terminal and type:

{% highlight ruby %}

apt-get install git

{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Step 2: Config Aliases in Bash</b></h1>
In order to be able to create and customize command line shortcuts, you must create aliases.
To create aliases, open the /root/.bash_aliases using nano or your favorite text editor. 
Add the following line to create an alias.

{% highlight ruby %}
alias ls='ls --color=always -rthla'
{% endhighlight %}
for example, we can create an aliases that will update Kali fully;
{% highlight ruby %}
function apt-updater {
	apt-get update &&
	apt-get dist-upgrade -Vy &&
	apt-get autoremove -y &&
	apt-get autoclean &&
	apt-get clean &&
	reboot
	}
{% endhighlight %}
now when we exit and run the command "apt-updater" in the terminal, that will invoke a series of updates, which makes it much faster.

<h1><b>Step 3: Install a Multiplexer Terminal</b></h1>
Multiplexer terminal is important to have, it helps the user to have multiple terminals opened in the same window. The benefit is to be able to see all open terminals at once and not in layers on top of each other.

Tilix is available in Kali's APT repositories and can be installed using the below command.

{% highlight ruby %}

apt-get install tilix

{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Step 4: Installing hacking tools</b></h1>
The new versions of Kali are made to be lighter and has less tools by default, which means we have to install it all manually, there is many tools out there but the most popular would be;

{% highlight ruby %}
apt-get install maltego metasploit-framework burpsuite wireshark aircrack-ng hydra nmap beef-xss nikto
{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Step 5: Installing Tor</b></h1>
Tor is normally is pre-installed in Kali, but we must make sure it’s installed and updated in order to stay anonymous. First, we need to add the Tor Project repositories to your APT repository list;

{% highlight ruby %}

echo 'deb https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org stretch main
deb-src https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org stretch main' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/tor.list

{% endhighlight %}

Then, download the Tor Project package signing key and import it into your APT keyring.
{% highlight ruby %}

wget -O- https://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org/A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89.asc | sudo apt-key add -

{% endhighlight %}

Now upgrade the APT using the below command;
{% highlight ruby %}

apt-get update

{% endhighlight %}

Install Tor using the below command, and you're done.
{% highlight ruby %}
apt-get install tor deb.torproject.org-keyring
{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Step 6: Install Atom code editor</b></h1>
To install Atom, head over to their website and download the latest Debian installer. Next, open a terminal and install the required dependencies using the below apt-get command.

{% highlight ruby %}
apt-get install gvfs gvfs-common gvfs-daemons gvfs-libs gconf-service gconf2 gconf2-common gvfs-bin psmisc
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, use dpkg, a command line package manager, with the install (-i) argument.

{% highlight ruby %}
dpkg -i ~/Downloads/atom-amd64.deb
{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Step 7: Change SSH Keys and  Default Password</b></h1>
To change the SSH keys, first, change into the directory. Doing the below two commands will reset the SSH keys from the default ones.

{% highlight ruby %}

cd /etc/ssh/
dpkg-reconfigure openssh-server

rescue-ssh.target is a disabled or a static unit, not starting it.

{% endhighlight %}

Now, for your Kali system's password, enter passwd root, then enter in your new password. Afterward, retype it to confirm. If you're not logged in as root, you may be asked for your current password before doing this.

{% highlight ruby %}

passwd root

Enter new UNIX password:
Retype new UNIX password:
passwd: password updated successfully

{% endhighlight %}
