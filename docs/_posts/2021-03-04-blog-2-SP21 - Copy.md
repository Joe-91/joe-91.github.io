<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>
In order to set up and run Node.JS web application on an Amazon AWS EC2 instance we must first launch at Linux instance with a DNS that is public and connect to it using SSH.

Also, we must have had configured our security group in order to allow the SSH on port 22. Hello is the steps on how to install Node.js on an Amazon Linux instance and to use this server in order host a web application.


<h1><b>The steps.</b></h1>
First, we need to connect to our instance as an ec2-user using SSH.
Second, we have to install (nvm) node version manager with the following commands.

Copy paste the below command;
{% highlight ruby %}
$ curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
{% endhighlight %}

Nvm will be used to install Node.js, because nvm can install mutiple versions of Node.js and allowes the user to choose between them

Third, we must activate nvm by typing the following at the command line;

{% highlight ruby %}
$ . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Fourth, we use nvm to install the latest version of Node.js with the following command;

{% highlight ruby %}
$ nvm install node
{% endhighlight %}

Installing Node.js comes with node package manager (npm) in order to install additional modules as needed.

Fifth, we test if node.js is installed correctly and running by typing the following command;

{% highlight ruby %}
$ node -e "console.log('Running Node.js ' + process.version)"
{% endhighlight %}

That will show the folloing message that displays the version of node.js that is running;
"Running Node.js VERSION"
