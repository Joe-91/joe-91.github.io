<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>
Terraform is a developed tool which is a open source by hashicorp to simplify structure. We can also find it in the programming language. Its job is to enable the user to simple solve problems by programming to specify and analyze the structure of the code withing the layout files and to rule the instruction through the number of cloud givers like AWS. 

The terraform workflow is to prepare a layout files on the machine where its announced the main things that we need to build for the structure. Also, in order to evaluate the setups and then build the necessary structure.

This guide will demonstrate how terraform on Ubuntu 18.04 can be built.

<h1><b>Terraform installation:</b></h1>
It’s really quick to mount terraform. Terraform can be accessed from the download’s website. Choose the required architecture and operating system kit, unzip the folder, and then transfer the binary to the directory that is used in the route variable. 

{% highlight ruby %}
mkdir ~/bin
{% endhighlight %}

on ubuntu, it will immediately be connected to the route if the directory is created.

Download the zip folder next. In order to update the new edition, visit the terraform on the download website.

{% highlight ruby %}
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.12.24/terraform_0.12.24_linux_amd64.zip
{% endhighlight %}

Uncompress the directory. A single binary is called terraform can be retrieved from the archive.

{% highlight ruby %}
unzip terraform_0.12.24_linux_amd64.zip
{% endhighlight %}

Transfer the binary terraform to a directory that is -/bin directory used in the direction of the device in the case.

{% highlight ruby %}
mv terraform ~/bin
{% endhighlight %}

in order to verify whether terraform is mounted, run:

{% highlight ruby %}
terraform version
# Terraform v0.12.24
{% endhighlight %}

Terraform docs are the perfect way to know the proper way of use terraform, and treat the structure. We can handle a lot of vendors with it.
