<h1><b>Intro</b></h1>
You need to have an SSH key to be able to push and pull and allow others to collaborate in your repositories. If you don't have an SSH key you must create one, but first you must check if you have one.

You can add the Key to the settings in order to not have to enter the passphrase each time you want to use your SSH key. Below I explain how to generate a key and how to add it to you GitHub account.

<h1><b>Generating a new SSH key.</b></h1>
First, open Git Bash.

Copy paste the below command and replace the end of it with your email.
{% highlight ruby %}
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
{% endhighlight %}

That command will create a new SSH key using the email you provided.

{% highlight ruby %}
> Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
{% endhighlight %}

when asked to enter a file location, just press enter for default location.

{% highlight ruby %}
> Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_ed25519):[Press enter]
{% endhighlight %}

when prompted, enter a secure paraphrase, or keep it empty for no paraphrase.

{% highlight ruby %}
> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]
{% endhighlight %}

<h1><b>Adding the SSH key to Github Account.</b></h1>
1. Copy the new generated SSH key.
2. In GitHub open settings from the top right of the page.
3. Then in settings click on SSH Keys.
